# orchestra-jsapi

`orchestra-jsapi` abstracts the functionality provided by [harmonyhubjs-client](https://github.com/swissmanu/harmonyhubjs-client) and [harmonyhubjs-discover](https://github.com/swissmanu/harmonyhubjs-discover) behind a vanilla JavaScript interface. Doing this, interaction with Logitechs Harmony hubs becomes a breeze for every Node.JS developer.


## Usages
* [orchestra](https://github.com/swissmanu/orchestra) uses `orchestra-jsapi` for interaction with Logitech Harmony hubs.
* There is an additional module called [orchestra-webapi](https://github.com/swissmanu/orchestra-webapi) which forwards `orchestra-jsapi` functions via REST and WebSockets.
