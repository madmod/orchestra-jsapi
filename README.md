# orchestra-api

A REST API for [harmonyhubjs-client](https://github.com/swissmanu/harmonyhubjs-client) and [harmonyhubjs-discover](https://github.com/swissmanu/harmonyhubjs-discover). It allows to control a Logitech Harmony hub via HTTP.

There is also an HTML client known as [orchestra-client](https://github.com/swissmanu/orchestra-client) available.
[orchestra](https://github.com/swissmanu/orchestra-client) combines the API and the client into a nice desktop application.
